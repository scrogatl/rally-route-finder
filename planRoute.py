"""
Plan a high-scoring rally route from bonus-lat-lon-points.csv without
calling the Google API.

Distances are straight-line (great circle) miles between bonuses, so they
are rough: real roads are longer. --road-factor pads them (1.23 fits Google's
road miles on average); --road-miles uses real road miles instead, from a
table buildRoadMiles.py makes with a local GraphHopper server. The route starts and ends at Rally HQ and must fit
in the time budget, including 5 minutes (--stop-minutes) at each bonus to
park and take its picture, 3 minutes of driving on every leg for getting off
the main road to the bonus (--leg-minutes), a 10-minute gas stop every 175
miles (--gas-miles, --gas-minutes), and slower driving through Atlanta (--slow-zone). If the
CSV has the hours bonuses are open (from the rally book, see
extractDatafromGPX.py), a bonus only counts while it's open, waiting there
if you arrive early, and reached at least 10 minutes before it closes
(--window-margin; --start sets the rally start, --ignore-hours skips it).
Combo bonuses (bonus-combos.csv, also from the rally book) add their points
when the route has every bonus in the combo (--ignore-combos skips them).

Picking the best set of stops is the "orienteering problem", which has no
fast exact solution, so this uses a heuristic: build a route by greedily
inserting the best points-per-hour bonus, then systematically try dropping
each run of stops, re-insert, and keep the result whenever it scores higher.
That is repeated starting from every bonus with several weightings, and the
best route is polished by trying to swap each stop for an unvisited bonus.
There is no randomness, so the same inputs always give the same route. It is
thorough rather than fast: expect several minutes.

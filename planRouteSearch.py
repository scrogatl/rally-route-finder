"""
Plan a rally route by classic tree search, with tunable heuristic cut-offs.

Where planRoute.py improves whole routes (insert, drop, swap) and
planRouteExact.py hands the problem to a constraint solver, this builds
routes the way a textbook AI search does: a route is a path from Rally HQ,
one stop at a time, and every partial route is a node in a tree whose
children add one more bonus that still leaves time to get back. Each node is
judged by f = g + H_WEIGHT x h, where g is the points so far (with any combo
it completes) and h is the most points the rest of the day could add: the
bonuses still reachable, best points per hour first, packed into the time
left as if each cost only its stop plus the quickest drive into it (a
"fractional knapsack"). A combo's points are shared among the stops it still
needs. h is never too low, so a branch whose f (with H_WEIGHT 1) is no more
than a route already found can't hold a better one.

Two search methods:

  beam  Breadth-first, one stop at a time, keeping only the BEAM_WIDTH best
        nodes at each depth by f, at most DIVERSITY of them ending at the
        same bonus. Of routes with the same stops ending at the same bonus,
        only the quickest is kept. Wider beams look at more routes and run
        longer; --widen keeps doubling the width until --time-limit.
        Expanding the beam is spread across all CPU cores.
  dfs   Depth-first branch and bound: follow the most promising child first,
        and skip any node whose f can't beat the best complete route so far
        (it starts from a beam search's best route, so it can skip from the
        start). H_WEIGHT below 1 prunes harder, so it's faster but may miss
        the best route. With --branch 0 and H_WEIGHT 1 nothing is cut off
        that could do better, so if it finishes before --time-limit, no
        route scores more: it proves days up to about 6 hours this way.

Both look at only the BRANCH best children of each node, by points per hour
of getting there, the main cut-off: lower is faster and greedier. The
settings, bonus hours, gas stops, slow zones, combos, --first and --must are
the same as planRoute.py's, and so are the printout and GPX. --polish
runs planRoute.py's drop-and-reinsert search on the result.

    python planRouteSearch.py                       # beam, width 2000, branch 12
    python planRouteSearch.py --widen --time-limit 120

"""
Combine the rally's bonus files into the files the planners read.

Takes each bonus's location from the rally's GPX file (the CSV's lat/lon may
be wrong) and its points from the rally's bonus CSV, and writes, in the
current directory, overwriting any earlier ones:

  bonus-lat-lon-points.csv  code, lat, lon, points, state, and with the rally
                            book, the hours each bonus is open
  bonus-combos.csv          with the rally book only: each combo's code,
                            points and the bonuses it needs
  bonus-lat-lon-points.gpx  the GPX with each bonus's points (and hours and
                            combos) in its name and description, for viewing
                            in BaseCamp or on a GPS, with Garmin number symbols
  bonus-lat-lon-points-gpxstudio.gpx
                            the same, with symbols GPX Studio shows instead

Without the rally book, the CSV has no hours and bonus-combos.csv isn't
written (an old one is left as it was). Check the warnings: a bonus with no
points in the CSV, or no hours in the rally book, is flagged.

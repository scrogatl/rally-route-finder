"""
Check a planned route against real roads with the Google Maps Routes API.

Reads the route from a GPX file written by planRoute.py or planRouteExact.py
(the newest one by default), asks Google for driving directions through the stops
in that order, and prints each leg's road miles and driving time, when you'd
arrive at and leave each stop, and whether the day still fits in the time
budget. It also prints a --road-factor and --speed for planRoute.py that
match Google's numbers, so the next plan can be closer to the real roads.

Stops are counted the same way as planRoute.py: --stop-minutes at each bonus
and --gas-minutes for every --gas-miles driven. Bonuses with hours (from the
rally book, in bonus-lat-lon-points.csv) are waited for if reached before
they open, and reported as missed if reached after they close. Combo
bonuses (bonus-combos.csv) score when every bonus in one is made in time.

Without --depart, the whole route goes in one request per 25 stops and the
times have no traffic. With --depart, each leg is its own request, leaving
when you'd leave that stop, and the times include Google's traffic forecast.

If the route is over time or misses a bonus's hours on Google's times, it
also looks for stops to drop so the rest fits, keeping the most points, and
writes that route as route-fit-DATE-TIME-POINTSpts.gpx to check next. Legs
that skip a dropped stop are estimated from Google's legs around them, so
check the fitted route with Google before riding it.

Google's times are for driving at about the usual speed. --highway-faster and
--surface-faster drive that many percent faster (or slower, if negative):
each turn-by-turn step Google averages --highway-mph or more on counts as
highway, every other step as surface streets. Traffic delays aren't changed.

Needs GMAPS_API_KEY in the environment, for a Google Cloud project with the
Routes API turned on. A check is usually inside Google's free monthly usage.
